# Student-Success-Rate-Calculator-

After completing the Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals certification, I wanted to use the skills that I learned about machine learning and the specific machine learning models and put it to use. I decided to use the Linear Regression model to predict a student's final mark based on specific events (test marks, studytime, failures, absences, etc). Through this project, my understanding of machine learning and Linear Regression specifically strengthened. 

The code uses Python's SKlearn library to train a model to predict Linear Regression charts. The code takes a student's first couple test marks, studytime, failures, number of absences and plots it on a graph. It then creates a best fit line and essentially predicts a student's final mark. The data (test marks, studytime, failures, absences, etc) is read using Python's Pandas library. It creates the data into readable columns for the Linear Regression model. After printing the predicted marks of all the student's, the code plots all of the marks onto a graph to show an average to the user. 

One challenge that I faced on this project was attempting to use Linear Regression and Machine Learning in general as it was all very new to me. However, through reference with the Azure AI Fundamentals content, and through useful links, I was able to overcome and create a working model that I understand.

Features that I would like to add to this project is to create a more accurate model by reading more events. The model itself is quite accurate already, but I feel with the addition of more events, it will only get more accurate.
